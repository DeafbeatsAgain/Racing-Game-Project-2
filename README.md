# Racing-Game-Project-2
My Personal learning project to apply concepts learned from class and friends

From RaceGame.java header notes:
Core loop of the game
1. start game
    2. display menu
        3. start new-game
            4. choose car
            5. choose track
            TODO: 6. set # of AI racers
            TODO: 7. set # of laps (option for default)
        8. simulate race
            9. display results

****
The next thing I want to work on will be adding functionality back in to set the number of AI drivers to race against,
and also give them random names based on a pool that I code in.
